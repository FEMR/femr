### CI
This repo uses Github Actions workflows for continuous integration, which can be found under the Actions tab in Github (https://github.com/CPSECapstone/zzs-femr/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Scala+CI%22). The Scala CI workflow runs 'sbt test' whenever code is pushed or a pull request is made to the main branch.

### Setting up weekly backup reminder

* It is very important for the administrator to backup local data to the remote database.
* A cronjob can be set up before a kit is deployed to automatically display a message once a week.

1. In the command line, type crontab -e
2. A text editor should appear.
3. Add the following line to this file: 0 11 * * 5 <path to fEMR project home directory>/util/WeeklyReminder.sh
4. This will display a reminder pop up at 11:00AM every Friday.

### Warnings

* fEMR is not HIPAA compliant (... yet).
* fEMR is not meant to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent disease.
* fEMR may attempt to establish a secure remote connection when internet access becomes available. This behavior is configurable and turned off by default.

# Setting up the project with IntelliJ on macOS

### Step 1: Download and Install the following Software and Dependencies 
- [IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- [MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
- [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)
- [Java JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

### Step 2: Clone the repo and checkout super-femr branch
- `git clone https://github.com/FEMR/femr.git`
- `git checkout super-femr`

### Step 3: Setting up the DB

### Step 4: Configuring IntelliJ

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate. Then open the `femr` project with `super-femr` branch checked out.

2. In IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and go to `Preferences` -> `Plugins` -> click `Marketplace` -> Then download `Scala` and `Play Framework`. Then restart the IDE.

3. Inside `femr/conf` folder, create a new file named  `application.dev.conf`. 
4. Copy the following settings inside and save it. Note that `db.default.username` and `db.default.password` values must match the account and password from the Step 3.3. For this example, my username is `testing` and password is `password`.

```
include "application.conf"
settings.researchOnly=0
db.default.url="jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/femr_db?characterEncoding=UTF-8"
db.default.username="testing"
db.default.password="password"
photos.defaultProfilePhoto="./public/img/defaultProfile.png"
csv.path="./Upload/CSV"
```

5. Go to `Run` -> `Edit Configurations` -> click on the `+` sign -> `Play 2 App`.

6. Then, click on `Edit Environment Variables` -> add the following two environment variables: `user.dir` and `config.file` (make sure to change the value based on where the two are stored on your local machine). Then click apply and ok.
    - `config.file` is the path for application.dev.conf.
    - `user.dir` is the path for the project.

7. Go to `File` -> `Project structure` -> Under the `Project` tab -> Select `Project SDK` and set it to 1.8. 
    - You can download 1.8 directly from IntelliJ. If so, choose 1.8 Amazon Correto.

9. On the rightmost side of IntelliJ, if there is a vertical line containing sbt. Click on the sbt tab and then click the refresh symbol.
      - If there isn’t sbt on the right, remove the .idea folder from the root directory of the project. In the command line, traverse to the root directory and do: rm -r .idea. Then redo step 2 and then continue. If still does not work try removing the project and recloning it again.

### Troubleshooting
1. Try deleting the .idea folder and rerunning sbt 
2. Confirm you have the absolute path in your environment variables
3. Try to re-apply the plugins Scala and Play Framework
4. Otherwise, try cloning the femr github and going through the steps once more.
5. Try invalidating Intellij IDEA cache.
